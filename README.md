# SealFisher

This game is now mainly being developed by @Finni08 as a learning project. This repository may not always reflect the latest changes. Check his project for more information: https://github.com/Finni08/SealFisher

A simple fishing game! You catch fish, sell them for ingame money and use that money to buy upgrades. The game hasn't got any real goal, you can set yourself your own goals, for example getting the biggest fish or getting as much money as possible.

At a later point in development, you'll also be able to archive certain fish so you don't sell them. An achievement system is also planned, as well as a bunch of new upgrades.

This project isn't really meant to be a long-term-development; it's rather used for me to understand C# and especially WPF better. This means that at some point, it will no longer receive updates, besides maybe bug fixes.

Also, since some of the fish you can catch are protected, here you have a legal disclaimer: This game does not support the fishing of protected species.
